#### 3.2 Vercel CLI Method (If you have CLI access)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Set production environment variables
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID production
# Enter your live client ID when prompted

vercel env add PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET production

## üîÑ **Step 4: Automated Environment Switching**

I'll create an automated script that you can run remotely:

### 4.1 Environment Detection Script
The system will automatically:
- Detect if `NODE_ENV=production`
- Use live PayPal credentials in production
- Use sandbox credentials in development/staging
- Switch API endpoints automatically

### 4.2 No Code Changes Required
Your existing code will automatically:
- Switch from sandbox to live PayPal API
- Use production webhook endpoints
- Apply live payment processing

---

## üß™ **Step 5: Testing & Validation**

### 5.1 Pre-Go-Live Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify live credentials are set correctly
- [ ] Test small payment (¬£1) from your own card
- [ ] Verify webhook receipt and order processing
- [ ] Test payment failure scenarios
- [ ] Verify order confirmation emails
- [ ] Test both pickup and delivery orders

### 5.2 Go-Live Validation
```bash
# Use this URL to test your live PayPal integration
https://tkafrokitchen.com/checkout?test=live

# Check PayPal dashboard for test transactions
https://www.paypal.com/activity
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Step 6: Critical Production Considerations**

### 6.1 Payment Limits
- **New PayPal accounts** may have receiving limits
- **Solution**: Contact PayPal to remove limits before go-live
- **Alternative**: Start with small transaction amounts

### 6.2 Fraud Protection
PayPal Live includes automatic fraud protection:
- Risk assessment on every transaction
- Some payments may be held for review
- Higher-risk transactions may be blocked

### 6.3 Dispute Management
- PayPal Seller Protection applies to eligible transactions
- Disputes handled through PayPal Resolution Center
- Keep detailed order records for dispute resolution

## üîí **Step 7: Security & Compliance**

### 7.1 PCI Compliance
‚úÖ **Your setup is PCI compliant** because:
- PayPal handles all card processing
- No card data touches your servers
- PayPal is PCI DSS Level 1 certified

### 7.2 Data Protection
- Customer data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- PayPal handles sensitive payment data
- Order data stored securely in your system

---

## üìä **Step 8: Monitoring & Analytics**

### 8.1 PayPal Reporting
- Transaction reports: PayPal Dashboard ‚Üí Reports
- Settlement reports: Automatic bank transfers
- Monthly statements: Emailed automatically

### 8.2 Your Website Analytics
- Payment success rate monitoring
- Failed payment tracking
- Order completion funnel analysis

---

## üö® **Emergency Rollback Plan**

If issues arise after going live:

### Quick Rollback to Sandbox
1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` back to sandbox ID
3. Redeploy (takes 2-3 minutes)

### Automatic Fallback
The system includes fallback handling:
- If live PayPal fails, shows "Payment system maintenance" message
- Customers can still place orders for manual processing
- No website downtime

---

## ‚úÖ **Step 9: Remote Deployment Execution**

### 9.1 Hands-Off Deployment Timeline
```
T-0: Update environment variables in Vercel
T+2min: Auto-deployment completes
T+5min: PayPal live integration active
T+10min: Run validation tests
T+15min: Confirm successful go-live
```

### 9.2 Zero-Downtime Switch
- Environment variable updates are instant
- No code deployment required
- No customer-facing downtime
