# 🚨 STAGING 500 ERROR - DEPLOYMENT FIX REQUIRED

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**
The 500 error on `staging.tkafrokitchen.com/checkout` is caused by the staging environment having the **old, broken checkout code**. All fixes are committed to git but need to be deployed to staging.

## ✅ **Fixes Committed & Ready**
- ✅ Critical checkout 500 error fixes committed (commit: 93fb4ce)
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and cart workflow
- ✅ Responsive design fixes for UI scaling
- ✅ PayPal integration improvements

3. Select a size and click "Add to Cart"
4. Verify no 500 error occurs
5. Check that cart modal opens properly
6. Test the complete checkout flow

## 📋 **Expected Results**

- ✅ After: Smooth checkout with enhanced PayPal integration
- ✅ Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- ✅ Professional two-step checkout process
- ✅ Real-time form validation
- ✅ Proper error handling

## 🔍 **If Error Persists After Deployment**

2. Verify the deployment completed successfully in Vercel
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Check that the latest commit (93fb4ce) is deployed
