# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Payment Success Redirect Fixed!

## âœ… **ISSUE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**

**Problem:** Payment processing worked perfectly, but `router.push('/success')` failed silently after PayPal callbacks.

**Root Cause:** Next.js router can fail in certain browser contexts (especially after popup interactions like PayPal).

**Solution:** Replaced `router.push()` with reliable `window.location.href = '/success'`

---

## ðŸ”§ **WHAT WAS CHANGED**

### **Before (Not Working):**
```javascript
router.push('/success');  // Failed silently after PayPal
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```javascript
window.location.href = '/success';  // Reliable browser navigation
```
