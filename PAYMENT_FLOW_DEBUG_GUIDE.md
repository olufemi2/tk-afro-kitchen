localStorage.setItem('lastOrderDetails', '{"orderId":"TEST_ORDER_' + Date.now() + '","status":"COMPLETED","amount":"45.99","timestamp":"' + new Date().toISOString() + '","customerInfo":{"fullName":"Test Customer","email":"test@example.com","phone":"07123 456789","address":"123 Test Street","city":"London","postcode":"SW1A 1AA"}}');
```
