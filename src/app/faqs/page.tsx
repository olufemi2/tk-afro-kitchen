If no arrangement is made for someone to be home on the day of the arranged delivery, unfortunately we will not be able to re-arrange or replace your order."

  },
  {
    category: "Orders",
    question: "CAN I PLACE CUSTOMISED ORDERS?",
    answer: "Yes, we can provide made to order food service for any meal types not captured on our menu list. Please leave a message on our board for any custom orders and we will get back to you."
